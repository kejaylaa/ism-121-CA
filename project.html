                    <h2>FREE ROYALTY</h2>
                    <p> this is my origin. my first official project which was given to me by my lecturer.the name was given to realise the burden of being royalty.freedom comes with no responsibilty and power, and power and responsibilty has no freedom coming with them. This sculpture signifies you can't be selfish and desire both</p>

                    <h2> THE SCULPTURED DINOSAUR</h2>
                    <p>This piece on it's own has a personal significance to me, as it was my first project to be successfully bought.The name simply present how such a feared creature was erased and brought to stone by the hands of humans. It shows how we human beings are destroying ourselves, but we refuse to acknowledge tat.thank you</p>

                    <h2>MAN'S WEAKNESS</h2>
                    <p> This art was inspired from one of my many failed relationships. it siginifies the act of stripping men from their so called power ,especially men who dont deserve it  and then proceeds to abuse it. As one of my favorite artist once said"under all that fancy armor, you are nothing but a sad vulnerable excuse of a man"</p>

                    <h2>WOUNDED NATURE</h2>
                    <p>It is said that we women are the true presentaion of nature as flesh. WE create. nuture,and strive for utter perfection. But such perfection can not be given or made so easily. This art of mine simply present that struggle</p>

                    <h2>GOOD VS evil</h2>
                    <p>This art represents the historical moment in the bible, that simply proves, that no matter what'Good and must conquer all'. in the art, you see the angel striking the devil, and casting it away from the light, forever to remain in the dark,as it should.Periodddddd</p>

                    <h2>THE LIVING FALLEN ANGEL</h2>
                    <p>This is my recent project as of to date.It's name on it's own has a pretty-dirty meaning.This project gives my perspective on the being that is HuMaN.It shows how the human being struggle with choosing the forces,despite knowing the obvious reason. It potrays the inner struggle that we face today as human</p>
