                    <p>
                        Oluchi is a 17-years old college student,who studies at a
                     well accomplished Nigeria university known as Pan-Atlantic university,or as it is called by the youth,P.A.U. 
                     she ia a well accomplished Sculpturist and she seeks to expand her talents to other country. she takes the fashion industry as a hobby more than a side job.
                    While scuplturing her main job, fashion designing is more of a cooping machanism for her mental health due to past experience.
                    We will still see more of her aspiring work, but as this artist is taking a hiatus, we wait patiently to the day she relase her splendid work.
